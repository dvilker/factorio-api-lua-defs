  ---@field allow_try_return_to_spawner boolean @If enabled, units that have nothing else to do will attempt to return to a spawner.
  ---@field do_separation boolean @If enabled, units will try to separate themselves from nearby friendly units.
  ---@field object_name string @The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.
  ---@field path_resolution_modifier int8 @Defines how coarse the pathfinder's grid is, where smaller values mean a coarser grid. Defaults to `0`, which equals a resolution of `1x1` tiles, centered on tile centers. Values range from `-8` to `8` inclusive, where each integer increment doubles/halves the resolution. So, a resolution of `-8` equals a grid of `256x256` tiles, and a resolution of `8` equals `1/256` of a tile.

It allows the mod to make any changes it deems appropriate to both the data structures in its [storage](runtime:storage) table or to the game state through [LuaGameScript](runtime:LuaGameScript).

--- Register a function to be run on mod initialization.
--- This is only called when a new save game is created or when a save file is loaded that previously didn't contain the mod. During it, the mod gets the chance to set up initial values that it will use for its lifetime. It has full access to [LuaGameScript](runtime:LuaGameScript) and the [storage](runtime:storage) table and can change anything about them that it deems appropriate. No other events will be raised for the mod until it has finished this step.

--- It gives the mod the opportunity to rectify potential differences in local state introduced by the save/load cycle.

The [storage](runtime:storage) table can be accessed and is safe to read from, but not write to, as doing so will lead to an error.
--- The only legitimate uses of this event are these:
--- - Re-setup [metatables](https://www.lua.org/pil/13.html) as they are not persisted through the save/load cycle.
--- - Re-setup conditional event handlers, meaning subscribing to an event only when some condition is met to save processing time.
--- - Create local references to data stored in the [storage](runtime:storage) table.
--- For all other purposes, [LuaBootstrap::on_init](runtime:LuaBootstrap::on_init), [LuaBootstrap::on_configuration_changed](runtime:LuaBootstrap::on_configuration_changed) or [migrations](runtime:migrations) should be used instead.

--- Register a metatable to have linkage recorded and restored when saving/loading.
--- The metatable itself will not be saved. Instead, only the linkage to a registered metatable is saved, and the metatable registered under that name will be used when loading the table.
--- `register_metatable()` can not be used in the console, in event listeners or during a `remote.call()`.

--- Registers an object so that after it's destroyed, [on_object_destroyed](runtime:on_object_destroyed) is called.
--- Once an object is registered, it stays registered until it is actually destroyed, even through save/load cycles. The registration is global across all mods, meaning once one mod registers an object, all mods listening to [on_object_destroyed](runtime:on_object_destroyed) will receive the event when it is destroyed. Registering the same object multiple times will still only fire the destruction event once, and will return the same registration number.

---@class LuaCustomTable: any @Lazily evaluated table. For performance reasons, we sometimes return a custom table-like type instead of a native Lua table. This custom type lazily constructs the necessary Lua wrappers of the corresponding C++ objects, therefore preventing their unnecessary construction in some cases. There are some notable consequences to the usage of a custom table type rather than the native Lua table type: Iterating a custom table is only possible using the `pairs` Lua function; `ipairs` won't work. Another key difference is that custom tables cannot be serialised into a game save file -- if saving the game would require serialisation of a custom table, an error will be displayed and the game will not be saved. In previous versions of Factorio, this would create a [LuaPlayer](runtime:LuaPlayer) instance for every player in the game, even though only one such wrapper is needed. In the current version, accessing [game.players](runtime:LuaGameScript::players) by itself does not create any [LuaPlayer](runtime:LuaPlayer) instances; they are created lazily when accessed. Therefore, this example only constructs one [LuaPlayer](runtime:LuaPlayer) instance, no matter how many elements there are in `game.players`. ``` game.players["Oxyd"].character.die() ``` This statement will execute successfully and `storage.p` will be useable as one might expect. However, as soon as the user tries to save the game, a "LuaCustomTable cannot be serialized" error will be shown. The game will remain unsaveable so long as `storage.p` refers to an instance of a custom table. ``` storage.p = game.players -- This has high potential to make the game unsaveable ``` The following will produce no output because `ipairs` is not supported with custom tables. ``` for _, p in ipairs(game.players) do game.player.print(p.name); end -- incorrect; use pairs instead ```

---@class LuaGuiElement: any @An element of a custom GUI. This type is used to represent [any kind](runtime:GuiElementType) of a GUI element - labels, buttons and frames are all instances of this type. Just like [LuaEntity](runtime:LuaEntity), different kinds of elements support different attributes; attempting to access an attribute on an element that doesn't support it (for instance, trying to access the `column_count` of a `textfield`) will result in a runtime error. For information on all supported GUI elements, see [GuiElementType](runtime:GuiElementType). Each GUI element allows access to its children by having them as attributes. Thus, one can use the `parent.child` syntax to refer to children. Lua also supports the `parent["child"]` syntax to refer to the same element. This can be used in cases where the child has a name that isn't a valid Lua identifier.

---@param can_open_gates boolean|nil @Whether the path request can open gates. Defaults to `false`.
---@param path_resolution_modifier int|nil @Defines how coarse the pathfinder's grid is, where smaller values mean a coarser grid. Defaults to `0`, which equals a resolution of `1x1` tiles, centered on tile centers. Values range from `-8` to `8` inclusive, where each integer increment doubles/halves the resolution.

--- Set tiles at specified locations. Can automatically correct the edges around modified tiles.
--- Placing a [mineable](runtime:LuaTilePrototype::mineable_properties) tile on top of a non-mineable or [foundation](runtime:LuaTilePrototype::is_foundation) one will turn the latter into the [LuaTile::hidden_tile](runtime:LuaTile::hidden_tile) for that tile. Placing a mineable tile on a mineable one or a non-mineable tile on a non-mineable one or a foundation tile on a foundation one will not modify the hidden tile. This restriction can however be circumvented by using [LuaSurface::set_hidden_tile](runtime:LuaSurface::set_hidden_tile). Placing a non-foundation tile on top of a foundation one when there already exists a hidden tile will push hidden tile to [double hidden](runtime:LuaTile::double_hidden_tile), and foundation tile will turn into hidden.
--- It is recommended to call this method once for all the tiles you want to change rather than calling it individually for every tile.

  ---@field tiles Tile[] @The tiles that were changed.

---@class ScriptRaisedTeleported: EventData @A static event mods can use to tell other mods they teleported something by script. This event is only raised if a mod does so with [LuaBootstrap::raise_event](runtime:LuaBootstrap::raise_event) or [LuaBootstrap::raise_script_teleported](runtime:LuaBootstrap::raise_script_teleported), or when `raise_teleported` is passed to [LuaControl::teleport](runtime:LuaControl::teleport).
  ---@field entity LuaEntity @The entity that was teleported.
  ---@field name defines.events @Identifier of the event
  ---@field old_position MapPosition @The entity's position before the teleportation.
  ---@field old_surface_index uint8 @The entity's surface before the teleportation.
  ---@field tick uint @Tick the event was generated.

--- `localised_print()` allows printing [LocalisedString](runtime:LocalisedString) to stdout without polluting the Factorio [log file](https://wiki.factorio.com/Log_file). This is primarily useful when communicating with external tools that launch Factorio as a child process.
---@param string LocalisedString
function localised_print(string) end


--- `log()` can print [LocalisedStrings](runtime:LocalisedString) to the Factorio [log file](https://wiki.factorio.com/Log_file). This, in combination with the serpent library, makes debugging in the data stage easier because it allows the inspection of entire prototype tables. For example, printing all properties of the sulfur item prototype can be done like so: `log(serpent.block(data.raw["item"]["sulfur"]))`
---@param string LocalisedString
function log(string) end


--- Factorio provides the `table_size()` function as a simple way to determine the size of tables with non-continuous keys, as the standard `#` operator does not work correctly for these. The function is a C++ implementation of the following Lua code, which is faster than doing the same in Lua:
--- ```
--- local function size(t)
---   local count = 0
---   for k,v in pairs(t) do
---     count = count + 1
---   end
---   return count
--- end
--- ```
--- Note that `table_size()` does not work correctly for [LuaCustomTable](runtime:LuaCustomTable), their size has to be determined with [LuaCustomTable::length_operator](runtime:LuaCustomTable::length_operator) instead.
---@param table table
---@return uint
function table_size(table) end
