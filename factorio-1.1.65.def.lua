function LuaBootstrap.get_event_handler(event) end

--- Gets the mod event order as a string.
---@return string
function LuaBootstrap.get_event_order() end

--- Register a function to be run when mod configuration changes. This is called when the major game version or any mod version changed, when any mod was added or removed, when a startup setting has changed, or when any prototypes have been added or removed. It allows the mod to make any changes it deems appropriate to both the data structures in its [global](global) table or to the game state through [LuaGameScript](LuaGameScript).
---@param f (fun(p0: ConfigurationChangedData)) | nil @The handler for this event. Passing `nil` will unregister it.

--- Register a handler to run on the specified event(s). Each mod can only register once for every event, as any additional registration will overwrite the previous one. This holds true even if different filters are used for subsequent registrations.
---@param event (defines__events|number) | ((defines__events|number)[]) | string @The event(s) or custom-input to invoke the handler on.
---@param f (fun(p0: EventData)) | nil @The handler for this event. Passing `nil` will unregister it.

function LuaBootstrap.on_event(event, f, filters) end

--- Register a function to be run on mod initialization. This is only called when a new save game is created or when a save file is loaded that previously didn't contain the mod. During it, the mod gets the chance to set up initial values that it will use for its lifetime. It has full access to [LuaGameScript](LuaGameScript) and the [global](global) table and can change anything about them that it deems appropriate.

--- Register a function to be run on save load. This is only called for mods that have been part of the save previously, or for players connecting to a running multiplayer session. It gives the mod the opportunity to do some very specific actions, should it need to. Doing anything other than these three will lead to desyncs, which breaks multiplayer and replay functionality. Access to [LuaGameScript](LuaGameScript) is not available. The [global](global) table can be accessed and is safe to read from, but not write to, as doing so will lead to an error.
--- The only legitimate uses of this event are the following:
--- - Re-setup [metatables](https://www.lua.org/pil/13.html) as they are not persisted through the save/load cycle.
--- - Re-setup conditional event handlers, meaning subscribing to an event only when some condition is met to save processing time.
--- - Create local references to data stored in the [global](global) table.
--- For all other purposes, [LuaBootstrap::on_init](LuaBootstrap::on_init), [LuaBootstrap::on_configuration_changed](LuaBootstrap::on_configuration_changed) or [migrations](migrations) should be used instead.
---@param f (fun()) | nil @The handler for this event. Passing `nil` will unregister it.

--- Registers an entity so that after it's destroyed, [on_entity_destroyed](on_entity_destroyed) is called. Once an entity is registered, it stays registered until it is actually destroyed, even through save/load cycles. The registration is global across all mods, meaning once one mod registers an entity, all mods listening to [on_entity_destroyed](on_entity_destroyed) will receive the event when it is destroyed. Registering the same entity multiple times will still only fire the destruction event once, and will return the same registration number.

---@class LuaFluidBox: any @An array of fluid boxes of an entity. Entities may contain more than one fluid box, and some can change the number of fluid boxes -- for instance, an assembling machine will change its number of fluid boxes depending on its active recipe. See [Fluid](Fluid). Do note that reading from a [LuaFluidBox](LuaFluidBox) creates a new table and writing will copy the given fields from the table into the engine's own fluid box structure. Therefore, the correct way to update a fluidbox of an entity is to read it first, modify the table, then write the modified table back. Directly accessing the returned table's attributes won't have the desired effect.
  ---@field object_name string @RW; The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.
  ---@field owner LuaEntity @RW; The entity that owns this fluidbox.
  ---@field valid boolean @RW; Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.

---@class LuaGuiElement: any @An element of a custom GUI. This type is used to represent any kind of a GUI element - labels, buttons and frames are all instances of this type. Just like [LuaEntity](LuaEntity), different kinds of elements support different attributes; attempting to access an attribute on an element that doesn't support it (for instance, trying to access the `column_count` of a `textfield`) will result in a runtime error. The following types of GUI element are supported: - `"button"`: A clickable element. Relevant event: [on_gui_click](on_gui_click) - `"sprite-button"`: A `button` that displays a sprite rather than text. Relevant event: [on_gui_click](on_gui_click) - `"checkbox"`: A clickable element with a check mark that can be turned off or on. Relevant event: [on_gui_checked_state_changed](on_gui_checked_state_changed) - `"flow"`: An invisible container that lays out its children either horizontally or vertically. - `"frame"`: A non-transparent box that contains other elements. It can have a title (set via the `caption` attribute). Just like a `flow`, it lays out its children either horizontally or vertically. Relevant event: [on_gui_location_changed](on_gui_location_changed) - `"label"`: A piece of text. - `"line"`: A horizontal or vertical separation line. - `"progressbar"`: A partially filled bar that can be used to indicate progress. - `"table"`: An invisible container that lays out its children in a specific number of columns. The width of each column is determined by the widest element it contains. - `"textfield"`: A single-line box the user can type into. Relevant events: [on_gui_text_changed](on_gui_text_changed), [on_gui_confirmed](on_gui_confirmed) - `"radiobutton"`: A clickable element that is functionally identical to a `checkbox`, but has a circular appearance. Relevant event: [on_gui_checked_state_changed](on_gui_checked_state_changed) - `"sprite"`: An element that shows an image. - `"scroll-pane"`: An invisible element that is similar to a `flow`, but has the ability to show and use scroll bars. - `"drop-down"`: A drop-down containing strings of text. Relevant event: [on_gui_selection_state_changed](on_gui_selection_state_changed) - `"list-box"`: A list of strings, only one of which can be selected at a time. Shows a scroll bar if necessary. Relevant event: [on_gui_selection_state_changed](on_gui_selection_state_changed) - `"camera"`: A camera that shows the game at the given position on the given surface. It can visually track an [entity](LuaGuiElement::entity) that is set after the element has been created. - `"choose-elem-button"`: A button that lets the player pick from a certain kind of prototype, with optional filtering. Relevant event: [on_gui_elem_changed](on_gui_elem_changed) - `"text-box"`: A multi-line `textfield`. Relevant event: [on_gui_text_changed](on_gui_text_changed) - `"slider"`: A horizontal number line which can be used to choose a number. Relevant event: [on_gui_value_changed](on_gui_value_changed) - `"minimap"`: A minimap preview, similar to the normal player minimap. It can visually track an [entity](LuaGuiElement::entity) that is set after the element has been created. - `"entity-preview"`: A preview of an entity. The [entity](LuaGuiElement::entity) has to be set after the element has been created. - `"empty-widget"`: An empty element that just exists. The root GUI elements `screen` and `relative` are `empty-widget`s. - `"tabbed-pane"`: A collection of `tab`s and their contents. Relevant event: [on_gui_selected_tab_changed](on_gui_selected_tab_changed) - `"tab"`: A tab for use in a `tabbed-pane`. - `"switch"`: A switch with three possible states. Can have labels attached to either side. Relevant event: [on_gui_switch_state_changed](on_gui_switch_state_changed) Each GUI element allows access to its children by having them as attributes. Thus, one can use the `parent.child` syntax to refer to children. Lua also supports the `parent["child"]` syntax to refer to the same element. This can be used in cases where the child has a name that isn't a valid Lua identifier.

--- global_functions 

--- `localised_print()` allows printing [LocalisedString](LocalisedString) to stdout without polluting the Factorio [log file](https://wiki.factorio.com/Log_file). This is primarily useful when communicating with external tools that launch Factorio as a child process.
---@param string LocalisedString
function localised_print(string) end


--- `log()` can print [LocalisedStrings](LocalisedString) to the Factorio [log file](https://wiki.factorio.com/Log_file). This, in combination with the serpent library, makes debugging in the data stage easier because it allows the inspection of entire prototype tables. For example, printing all properties of the sulfur item prototype can be done like so: `log(serpent.block(data.raw["item"]["sulfur"]))`
---@param string LocalisedString
function log(string) end


--- Factorio provides the `table_size()` function as a simple way to determine the size of tables with non-continuous keys, as the standard `#` operator does not work correctly for these. The function is a C++ implementation of the following Lua code, which is faster than doing the same in Lua:
--- ```
--- local function size(t)
---     local count = 0
---     for k,v in pairs(t) do
---         count = count + 1
---     end
---     return count
--- end
--- ```
--- Note that `table_size()` does not work correctly for [LuaCustomTable](LuaCustomTable), their size has to be determined with [LuaCustomTable::length](LuaCustomTable::length) instead.
---@param table table
---@return uint
function table_size(table) end

---@shape AutoplaceControl
  ---@field frequency MapGenSize @For things that are placed as spots such as ores and enemy bases, frequency is generally proportional to number of spots placed per unit area. For continuous features such as forests, frequency is how compressed the probability function is over distance, i.e. the inverse of 'scale' (similar to terrain_segmentation). When the [LuaAutoplaceControlPrototype](LuaAutoplaceControlPrototype) is of the category `"terrain"`, then scale is shown in the map generator GUI instead of frequency.
  ---@field size MapGenSize @For things that are placed as spots, size is proportional to the area of each spot. For continuous features, size affects how much of the map is covered with the thing, and is called 'coverage' in the GUI.

The default 'cliffiness' expression interprets this value such that larger values result in longer unbroken walls of cliffs, and smaller values (between `0` and `1`) result in larger gaps in cliff walls.

  ---@field property_expression_names table<string, string> @Overrides for tile property value generators. Values either name a NamedNoiseExpression or can be literal numbers, stored as strings (e.g. `"5"`). All other controls can be overridden by a property expression names. Notable properties: - `moisture` - a value between 0 and 1 that determines whether a tile becomes sandy (low moisture) or grassy (high moisture). - `aux` - a value between 0 and 1 that determines whether low-moisture tiles become sand or red desert. - `temperature` - provides a value (vaguely representing degrees Celsius, varying between -20 and 50) that is used (together with moisture and aux) as part of tree and decorative placement. - `elevation` - tiles values less than zero become water. Cliffs are placed along certain contours according to [CliffPlacementSettings](CliffPlacementSettings). - `cliffiness` - determines whether (when >0.5) or not (when <0.5) a cliff will be placed at an otherwise suitable (according to [CliffPlacementSettings](CliffPlacementSettings)) location. - `enemy-base-intensity` - a number that is referenced by both `enemy-base-frequency` and `enemy-base-radius`. i.e. if this is overridden, enemy base frequency and size will both be affected and do something reasonable. By default, this expression returns a value proportional to distance from any starting point, clamped at about 7. - `enemy-base-frequency` - a number representing average number of enemy bases per tile for a region, by default in terms of `enemy-base-intensity`. - `enemy-base-radius` - a number representing the radius of an enemy base, if one were to be placed on the given tile, by default proportional to a constant plus `enemy-base-intensity`. Climate controls ('Moisture' and 'Terrain type' at the bottom of the Terrain tab in the map generator GUI) don't have their own dedicated structures in MapGenSettings. Instead, their values are stored as property expression overrides with long names: - `control-setting:moisture:frequency:multiplier` - frequency (inverse of scale) multiplier for moisture noise. Default is 1. - `control-setting:moisture:bias` - global bias for moisture (which normally varies between 0 and 1). Default is 0. - `control-setting:aux:frequency:multiplier` - frequency (inverse of scale) multiplier for aux (called 'terrain type' in the GUI) noise. Default is 1. - `control-setting:aux:bias` - global bias for aux/terrain type (which normally varies between 0 and 1). Default is 0. All other MapGenSettings feed into named noise expressions, and therefore placement can be overridden by including the name of a property in this dictionary. The probability and richness functions for placing specific tiles, entities, and decoratives can be overridden by including an entry named `{tile|entity|decorative}:(prototype name):{probability|richness}`.
